# Underground Energy Distribution
This mod is a fork of:
 - [SLP - Underground Poles](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/slp-underground-poles) by [SLywnow](https://mods.factorio.com/user/SLywnow)
 - [SLP - Underground Poles Fix](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/slp-underground-poles-fix) by [EGOR555565](https://mods.factorio.com/user/EGOR555565)

### Why fork it?
I generally dislike the reach of the base-game electric poles and this is an attempt to improve quality of life in the game by adjusting both the recipes, graphics, and reach of the electric poles etc of the mod.

### Current State of Development
This is currently WIP, and will have bugs that the others don't. I don't recommend installing this for now.

It has been modified so it is incompatible with the originals, this is because of how differently the poles are going to work, and so it's probably best making them not cross-compatible because installing this will break your factory otherwise. You should be able to safely install this alongside the SLP mod though.
